                The best real estate websites are polished and human. The agent should be front and center but content should be focussed on helping potential buyers and sellers.

They’re designed to generate leads but they don’t use invasive pop-ups or demand visitors give up an email address to access content. Instead they are calm and available for whenever the visitor is ready to get in touch.

Great real estate websites know the best form of marketing is education. So they provide resources to help potential buyers and sellers. Photography is deeply important to real estate on the web.

There are conventional features— real estate search, current properties, neighborhood guides— but almost every realtor website has these. The real way to differentiate is by educating and being human.
               VIB is fast disrupting the technical evaluation market by evaluating candidates on expertise rather than experience.

          <h2>About Us</h2>
          <p>Manual Technical Interviews are extremely effort-intensive for enterprises and takes a huge toll on their HR and Technical teams. This process of manual interviews often adversely impacts the quality of candidates and onboarding time that lead to multi-million rupees of business losses. The core issue is VIB doesn’t have the time, effort, and ability to determine the right people. So I wondered if it would be possible to have a bot that would complete a more reasonable judgment of the candidate, based on its build-in knowledge and the criteria of the employer. 90% of resumes are totally a waste of time because the packaging for resumes is definitely overdone at the moment. Compared to the words, the video might be the better alternative for employers. Although the use of video still won't prevent cheating, it should significantly improve accuracy and the amount of information included. So this is the initial idea of VIB, it’s a combination product of AI knowledge, video analysis, and bot. VIB clearly understands the huge potential in automating this critical business function and leverage Deep tech with NLP to take the technical interviews to a whole new level. VIB can conduct technical video interviews in realtime and also auto evaluate the candidate responses without any involvement from the technical experts. Its state-of-the-art algorithms record and evaluate candidate responses and tailor the next question based on previous answers. This adaptive interview style gives it a real-life feel and takes away the performance stress on candidates usually involved during manual interviews. It thus enables the candidates to showcase their best skills which ultimately helps the organization to acquire the best talent. The Bot automatically evaluates candidate responses and creates a Report. VIB is fast disrupting the technical evaluation market by evaluating candidates on expertise rather than experience.</p>
